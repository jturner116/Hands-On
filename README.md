# Hands-On
Code and practice from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow"

These code examples are helpful references for other projects and help me keep track of what I have been learning. This is an excellent book, but I also often refer 
to the same concepts in the Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. I've found that reading about an implementation in both books is a great way to 
cement my understanding.
